### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Jacques idea:
A web app like tinder where individuals are like boys and companies are like
girls.  Once they find a match they have an interview, and if all goes well
they exchange numbers, meet up, have anal sex, and never talk to each other
again... or the company hires the person and they live happily every after until
one of them gets bored and secretly downloads this tinder again, etc.
